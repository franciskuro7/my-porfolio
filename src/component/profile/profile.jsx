                            Hey! I'm Francis Kuro, a Full Stack Website Developer from
                            Pakistan who loves building websites that make businesses
                            stand out. I work with React, TypeScript, Node.js,
                            and WordPress to create fast, user-friendly sites that
                            actually solve problems. I'm always
                            excited to take on new challenges. Got a project in mind?
                            Let's make it happen!
